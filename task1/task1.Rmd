The code below shows how to plot a graph in r

Define 2 vectors
```{r}
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
trucks <- c(2, 5, 4, 5, 12)
```
First, graph cars using a y axis that ranges from 0 to 12. Second,
graph trucks with red dashed line and square points. Lastly,
create a title with a red, bold/italic font
```{r}
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue", ylim=c(0,12))
lines(trucks, type="o", pch=22, lty=2, col="red")
title(main="Autos", col.main="red", font.main=4)
```
